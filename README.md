maNGO technology is built to empower real world services with access to pertinent digital data streams.

Objectives
-----      
Our intent is to integrate information from disparate sources into a coherent searchable database that though intellegent recommender algorithms and search filters provides users with systems of data managment and data visualization to engender a smarter, more informed decision making process.

Description of program architecture

We use Spring MVC for maNGO application which is a Model-view-Controller framework in Java. The user interface is developed by html, JavaScript, and CSS which allows users to enter information and recieve results. The data streamming from user interface is going to the Controller of Spring MVC. The controller is responsible for communication with database and performming algorithm. All data stream is to or from MongoDB.
